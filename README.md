# Command Line Basics

cd = change directory --> use this to change folder locations

git add = add any files that you've modified on your local machine to the "staging area". Files in the staging area are the files that will be "committed" to GitHub when you subsequently do a "git push".

git push = upload modified files in the staging area to GitHub

git pull = download changes from GitHub to your local machine

git status = this command shows any files that are in the staging area. It also will tell you if you have modified any files that you should consider adding to the staging area.

ls = this will show you all the files that are in your current directory

cd .. = (remember the space in front of the two dots) --> this will "go up" one directory

cd ~ = this will bring you back to your "home" directory (maybe that means "Desktop" for you?)

touch [file_name] = create a new file (remember the file suffix. e.g. ".js")

git checkout [branch_name] = change branches

git branch [branch_name] = create a new branch (will not necessarily SWITCH to that new branch though. You'll need to checkout that new branch to switch to it). --> **not 100% sure if this is the right syntax for this command**
